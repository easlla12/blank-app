st.write('''The **Personal Loan Approval Prediction tool** can be used to help work out if 
         you are likely to have a loan application accepted or rejected *without* affecting your credit score. 
         It's outcome is based on a series of different variables. These include:

- Amount borrowed
- Home ownership
- Income
- Interest rate

If any variables are changed, a new prediction will be made based on the updated information.

The Personal Loan Approval Predictor gives an approximate answer based on historical data. 
         It cannot provide a guarantee on how your application will be received.''')
